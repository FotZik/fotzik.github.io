My name is Fredrik Jonsson, I'm 29 years old and I currently live in Pite책.
I have a daughter that's 4 years old (turning 5 2016) which takes a lot of my time (the reason why I'm studying from
distance). I'm originally from Skellefte책, which of course means I follow the local hockey team Skellefte책 AIK.
Beside hockey I only really follow one more sport, football. We don't really have any good local teams up north, but
I do follow Skellefte책 FF from time to time.

Beside hockey and football I also have a big interest in computers and gaming. When it comes to gaming I mostly play
Blizzard games (World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, etc).
 
When it comes to education I'm a fully certified network technician (Cisco). I've worked about ~2-3 years with computers
before I decided to go back to school and learn more about coding (I've always wanted to learn programming).

So currently I'm reading the program "Utveckling och Drift av Mjukvarusystem". The goal with the program is to be able
to work as a programmer (no specific type).

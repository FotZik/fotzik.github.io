My name is Fredrik Jonsson, I'm 29 years old and I currently live in Piteå.
I have a daughter that's 4 years old (turning 5 2016) which takes a lot of my time (the reason why I'm studying from
distance). I'm originally from Skellefteå, so of course I follow hockey a lot (Skellefteå AIK), besides hockey I don't
really follow any other sports.

Beside gaming and hockey I also have a big interest in computers. I have an education in networking (mostly Cisco),
but I've always wanted to learn about coding and building websites.
So I'm currently reading the program "Utveckling och Drift av Mjukvarusystem", but before that I used to work as a
computer technician.

<h1 class="post-title">Welcome to Fredrik Jonsson's presentation site for 1dv022.</h1>

<p class="padding-top-bot-20 padding-bot-40">Welcome to Fredrik Jonsson's presentation site for
    1dv022. 1dv022 is a Client-based Web programming course given by Linnéunniversitetet in Kalmar and Växjö.
    It's a continuation of 1dv021 An introduction to programming.
    <br><br>
    On this site you'll be able to read a little bit about me and my interests. I will also blog throughout
    the course and all blog posts will be open to comments. Most blogs will tackle my thoughts about what
    we are learning but there also be some examination blog posts where I answer questions the teachers have
    asked us.

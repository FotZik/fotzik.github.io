####**Well not really, but it will have to do for now.**
I just finished the last git push for the blog, so far it's been a really good learning experience with the first
examination. I'm not 100% happy with the website so I will make improvements throughout the 1dv022 course.

Now back to 1dv056 and some Java programming, I can't thank enough that I read 1dv021 before starting 1dv056, it really
made things a lot easier since the languages are so similar.

Well this is all for now, hopefully I'll have some time to go through the CSS code and make some improvements to the
website, maybe add some images because it's kinda boring now. I just didn't have the time to either create them myself
or finding free ones that are suitable for the site.

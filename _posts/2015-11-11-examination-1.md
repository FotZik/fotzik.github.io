In examination 1 we were required to answer 6 questions regarding the process of setting up the examination, and what
we thought about it. Some of the questions also target information brought up during the first lecture.

####**The 6 questions are:**
1. What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
 * Compare to regular CSS
 * Which techniques did you use?
 * Pros and cons?
2. What do you think of static site generators?
 * What type of projects are they suitable for?
3. What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
4. What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
5. How did you implements comments to blog posts
6. What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

So here are my answers to the questions above.

####**What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?**
Pre-compiling your CSS lets you use variables in CSS code. Meaning you can do less DRY and makes it easier to maintain
the CSS code.

####**What do you think of static site generators?**


####**What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?**
robots.txt is a way to control what search bots can index and cannot index. You can disallow certain folders and files
from being indexed. You can also limit it to certain types of bots, for example BadBot, Google, etc.

I decided for my site to not allow anything since this is more of a private website for me, my fellow students and the
teachers. I do not want the website to be indexed by search bots.
